## Description 
    The first program takes in input for a fully parenthesized arithmetic expression with binary operators and converts it into an expression tree and is able to print out the expression in preorder, inorder and post order. The program is also able to update variables and calculate the final result of the expression.

    The second program is an implementation of the heap sort algorithm. It takes in a dat or txt file and takes the first 3 values of the row and creates a key and the last 7 vales are the objects data elements. The program takes the keys and implements a heap sort to sort the objects in an array representation. 

## Compilation
    make

## Clean up
    make clean

## Usage
    Run executables

## Note
    the first progrm requires an expression as the first arguement and the second program requires that a file be included in arguement 1

## Known Limitations
    heaps: files must be in format 20x10 array
