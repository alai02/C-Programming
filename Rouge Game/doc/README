Testing: The hard and easy files that were provided by justin were used to test this program. 
Known Limitations: Sometimes running into stairs is a bit glitchy and takes 2 presses into the stairs to exit the game/
NOTE: I decided to make the player move to a random door because i thought it would 
be more interesting this way. Sorry for violating the spec <3
