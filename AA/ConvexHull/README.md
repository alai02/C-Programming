## Description
    numInvBrute: uses a brute force method to read in an array of integers in TestFile.txt and prints out the amount of inversions that are present in the data set along with the calculated runtime of the implementation.

    numInvMerge: uses a merge sort method to read in an array of integers in TestFile.txt and prints out the number of inversions that are present in the data set along with the calculated runtime of the implementation.

    convHullBrute: uses a brute force sorting method to read in the data set of x,y coordinates from TestFile2.txt and will determine the convex hull of the points. This algorithm took 4903 time units to complete its running time for this data set

    convHullMerge: uses a merge sort method to divide the points into smaller and smaller sets using the data from TestFile2.txt and will determine the convex hull set with its running time. I got a running time of 24 time units for this algorithms running time for this data set
