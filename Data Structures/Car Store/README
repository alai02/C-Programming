
The first program is a store database for a car rental company in which the user can perform various tasks 
on the car lists 

The second program is a post fix calculator where the mathematical expression is  represented in 
post fix for ex: 1+2 is written as 12+



Compilation: make



Usage: run executables ./q1 or ./q2

Limitations: q1.c does not read from a file or write to a file. Add data needs to be inseted directly from the user during run time.

					Question 2 will only work for basic post fix expressions.
