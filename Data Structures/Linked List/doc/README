Assignment: Linked List assignment A4, this assignment is to create a linked list of food items that are read in from a csv file and ordered in the list. 
Compilation: to compile type "make" with no quotations. 
Usage: To run type "./tracker assets/test.csv" with no quotes or any .csv file you like.
Testing: Tested linked list files using various test file variations. Also used print statements to find where errors were happening. Used valgrind
		 if and where memory leakes were occuring.
Known Limitations: Entering numbers greater than the max integer size will cause an error. 
References: A4 spec was read, browsed though the various discusion posts and found the post about where to include the parse code useful. No other outside sources were used.
